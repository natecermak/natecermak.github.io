## introduction
I gravitate towards open-source hardware and software development for biology and health-related applications, and I like learning about new projects. I may be available for consulting - please reach out to me at natecermak@pm.me.

## expertise
Hardware: I enjoy being able to work on hardware and software simultaneously. Many of my projects have involved developing physical hardware, from an automated low-cost microscope, to an electrical stimulator for neuroscience research. I've developed circuits and PCBs, optical trains, and mechanical hardware for experimentation and implanted devices.

Programming: I'm a strong software developer in C, Python, R, and Labview with experience in C++, Verilog. I've done projects ranging from web dashboards to embedded firmware in implanted devices to FPGA real-time high-speed digital signal processing work.

Theory: I have a strong background in statistics and signal processing, and frequently apply this expertise to hardware and software design.

## you aren't just your work!
That's a good one to remember, even when it feels false. I get a lot of joy out of running (especially trail running), bouldering, swimming (especially open water), scuba and freediving to look at critters. I like music a lot in most of its forms, and discovering new music I love is a huge form of joy. I'm a pretty so-so cook but I also get joy out of cooking with/for people. I also really like teaching people about things I know well.
