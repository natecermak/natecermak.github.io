## introduction

I am a biologist and an engineer, excited about making new tools to enable faster and more accessible science. Iâ€™ve developed technologies spanning electronics, optics, microfluidics, statistics, signal processing, and algorithmic development, and applied them across areas from microbiology to neuroscience.

I gravitate towards open-source hardware and software development for biology and health-related applications, and I like learning about new projects. I may be available for consulting - please reach out to me at nate.cermak@pm.me.

## expertise
Hardware: I enjoy being able to work on hardware and software simultaneously. Many of my projects have involved developing physical hardware, from an automated low-cost microscope, to an electrical stimulator for neuroscience research. I've developed circuits and PCBs, optical trains, and mechanical hardware for experimentation and implanted devices.

Programming: I'm a strong software developer in C, Python, R, and Labview with experience in C++, Verilog. I've done projects ranging from web dashboards to embedded firmware in implanted devices to FPGA real-time high-speed digital signal processing work.

Theory: I have a strong background in statistics, data analysis, and signal processing, and frequently apply this expertise to hardware and software design.

## professional experience

- *2022-07 - present*: [Starfish Neuroscience](https://starfishneuroscience.com/).
    - At Starfish, I'm working to develop an injectable (1-D), wireless, battery-free implant for neural recording and stimulation.
- *2020-01 - 2022-06*: [Neuralink](https://neuralink.com/). At Neuralink, I
    - did the company's first stimulation experiments visualizing neural activation in vivo and assessing behavioral responses
    - built the company's internal implant data visualization dashboard
    - developed an approach for rapid impedance measurements that improved measurement speed from 30 minutes to 30 seconds.
    - discovered shorting problems between electrodes and developed tests for systematically assessing shorts
    - developed a hardware-in-the-loop CI/CD framework for full system testing, from firmware to neural decoding to game implementation.
    - developed ultra high-throughput electrochemical test equipment (64-channel potentiometer/current-controlled stimulator)
- *2017-10 - 2019-12*: [Schiller lab, Technion](https://http://schillerj.net.technion.ac.il/).
    - I studied dendritic dynamics using multiphoton imaging in vivo, looking for evidence of branch-specific spiking and spatially-localized computations, as might be expected for NMDA spikes.
    - I built an open-source electrical stimulator that is now used by labs around the world.
- *2016-10 - 2017-09*: [Flavell lab, MIT](https://flavell.mit.edu/):
    - I studied coordination between motor behaviors in a simple model organism, C. elegans, from timescales of seconds to days.
    - I built an open-source low-cost motorized microscope for long-term tracking and behavioral recording of C. elegans, used by multiple labs.
- *2010-06 - 2016-05*: [Manalis](http://manalis-lab.mit.edu/) and [Polz](https://www.microbial-ecology.net/people/martin-polz) labs, MIT
    - I developed novel high-throughput inertial mass sensors for measuring the growth of single cells, with applications from marine microbiology, antibiotic resistance, and cancer biology.
    - I developed an FPGA-based hardware platform for controlling resonators and measuring their resonances rapidly and precisely in closed-loop, using digitally-implemented analog phased-locked loops.

## education

- *2010-06 - 2016-05*: **PhD**. MIT Computational and Systems Biology
- *2005-09 - 2010-03*: **BS, BA**. University of Washington, majors in Applied Math, Biochemistry (BS), Sociology (BA), minor in Chemistry

## publications
Please see my [google scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5FN4gzUAAAAJ) for the most up-to-date list. PDFs are provided [here](publications.html) because publishers are greedy, evil corporations.

## do i exist outside work?
I hope so. I enjoy running (especially trail running), bouldering, swimming (especially open water), scuba and freediving to look at critters. I like music in most of its forms, and discovering new music is a big source of joy for me. I'm a pretty so-so cook but I also get joy out of cooking with/for people. I also really like teaching people about things I know well. I'd like to have more community in my life.
